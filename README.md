AkashaCMS test site for use in performance testing

The idea is to have a large number of documents to work on improving the time-to-render for a large site.

This is structured so we can easily create more rendered documents without having to create more input documents.  This was done with a little trick in `config.js`:

```
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs01' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs02' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs03' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs04' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs05' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs06' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs07' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs08' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs09' })
    .addDocumentsDir({ src: 'docs100', dest: 'docs10' })
```

This uses the `docs100` directory multiple times as a documents directory, but each time with a different destination directory.  Since `docs100` has 100 document files, this means we've specified 1000 documents.  And it's easy to do this again to have 2000 documents, or 10,000 documents, or more.

The documents in question are fairly tame.  It would be useful to have sample documents with other characteristics.  But it would probably not be useful to have documents that rely on 3rd parties - no YouTube videos etc - because of the variable times to render content relying on queries to 3rd party services like OEmbed.
